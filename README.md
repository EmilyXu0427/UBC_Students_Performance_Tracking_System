(A system designed for professors to evaluate students' performance in CPSC210)
</p>

**Purpose and original interest**

Computer Science is a practical subject including both theory knowledge and hands-on practices. Therefore, the course design can be very challenging and usually includes various components such as lectures and labs. With hundreds of students taking this course every year, it is difficult to tell how students doing in this course, and how the knowledge and information have been absorbed by the students. Are they doing well/bad in particular session? Which session the professor should put more information or practice so the students can absorb the inforamation more effectively and efficiently? The purpose of this system is to provide insight for professors on the student's performance in this course.  

**End user and potential functions**
    
This application is mainly designed for professors to store and evaluate the information of students in CPSC 210 course. 
This application should be able to carry out the following functions:  <br>
✅ Load previously saved data into system when the user start the app <br>
✅ The app store individual student's information, such as StudentID, and student's grades including project, midterm, final, total grade and total performance (A, B, C, D, F).<br>
✅ Professor can use this app to add, find, and delete students (using StudentID) from the list.<br>
✅ Provide options for user to save the changes or not when exit the app<br>
✅ Print event log to the console after exit<br>
